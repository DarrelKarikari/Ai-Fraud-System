Futuristic Fraud Detection System
Overview
The Futuristic Fraud Detection System is a web application designed to detect fraudulent transactions using advanced machine learning algorithms. It consists of both backend and frontend components, providing a seamless user experience for inputting transaction data and visualizing fraud predictions.

Backend Features
1. Data Preprocessing
Load and Preprocess Data: Preprocesses transaction data by loading CSV files, handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and oversampling using SMOTE to address class imbalance.
Advanced Feature Engineering: Enhances data by adding advanced features like polynomial features and NLP features to improve model performance.
2. Model Training
Gradient Boosting Classifier: Trains a Gradient Boosting Classifier using grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics like ROC-AUC score and classification report.
3. Flask API
RESTful API: Provides a Flask API for making predictions on new transaction data.
API Endpoints: Exposes endpoints for predicting fraud probabilities and integrating with the frontend.
Frontend Features
1. User Interface
Input Transaction Data: Allows users to input transaction data, including date, amount, and various features.
Prediction Chart: Visualizes fraud predictions using a line chart to display the probability of fraud over time.
2. Navigation
Navbar: Provides navigation links to different pages, including the dashboard, about page, and contact page.
3. Error Handling
Not Found Page: Displays a 404 page when users navigate to non-existing routes, providing a user-friendly error message.
